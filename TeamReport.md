# Executive Summary

### Potential prototypes

1.  UI/UX -

- Login page
- Homepage
- Image upload / metadata page

2. Database design

- Entitiy modelling for two user types (Admin/Researcher & User/Citizen scientist)
- Database design for storing images and metadata
- Maybe some basic ACLs on admin / user func

3. Simple functionality

- Handle user login
- Build a simple prototype that allows users to upload images and metadata
- Basic API for CRUD operations on images and metadata

UI/UX can be done in figma or something simialar backend will be dotnet core and database will be postgresql - For basic prototyping can use Typescript/React with a mobile design focus
